---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Liston ME fMRI Preprocessing Pipeline scripts predicated on these pipelines
- before running, see example file structure required

Preprocessing -------------------------------------------------------

1. Structural Preprocessing Pipeline
    1. PreFreeSurfer.sh
    2. FreeSurfer.sh
    3. PostFreeSurfer.sh

2. Functional Preprocessing Pipeline (after struct preproc)
    - dirs are created for task ana during this step, so know how tasks will be modeled/analyzed
    1. Generic fMRI volume preprocessing (always do this step before surface preproc)
    2. Generic fMRI surface preprocessing

Optional Processing ---------------------------------------------------

3. ICA FIX Pipeline Pipeline (after functional preprocessing)
    - ICA-based denoising pipline
    - regresses out motion timeseries and artifact independent components

4. MSAII Pipeline (after functional preprocessing and ICA FIX processing)
    - re-registration of cortical surfaces
    - uses cortical folding, myelin map, and rsfMRI data

Task Analysis, i.e. tfMRI Processing -------------------------------------

5. Preparing for Level 1 tfMRI Analysis (after functional preprocessing)
    - also recommended to do ICA FIX and temporal ICA (tICA) before this step
    - Level 1 is for within-subs, within-runs ana

    1. Level 1 FEAT setup (FSF) files for ea direction of fnctl task
        - use templates in HCP directory: ${HCPPIPEDIR}/Examples/fsf_templates
        - num time pts in template must match num time pts in corresponding scan
        - see Mumford FSL Tutorial notes for search-and-replace script to create FSF files
        - copy template for a scan into: MNINonLinear/Results/<task>
        - make sure num time pts matches num volumes for the scan
        - can use script: ${HCPPIPEDIR}/Examples/Scripts/generate_level1_fsf.sh to extract num time pts from img file and set num vols in FSF file
        - must do this for every task direction so there is an FSF file for each

    2. E-Prime EV files in MNINonLinear/Results subdir for ea task
        - this subdirectory is created during Functional Preprocessing Pipeline, so can't do this until after that
        - each task has its own dir, so must do this for each
        - also, this means I have to understand how the tasks will be modeled before functional preprocessing
        - use script: ${HCPPIPEDIR}/Examples/Scripts/copy_evs_into_results.sh to copy EV files to this directory

6. Preparing for Level 2 tfMRI Analysis (after functional preprocessing)
    1. Level 2 FEAT setup files for ea task direction for which there will be level 2 ana
        - must be in dir: <StudyFolder>/100307/MNINonLinear/Results/<task>/<subj><task>.fsf
        - can copy template: ${HCPPIPEDIR}/Examples/fsf_templates/tfMRI_EMOTION_hp200_s4_level2.fsf to run example analysis
        - likely will have to create level 2 results directory: <StudyFolder>/100307/MNINonLinear/Results/<Study Name>

Diffusion Preprocessing -----------------------------------------------------------
- requires structural preprocessing already complete
- see script: ${HCPPIPEDIR}/Examples/Scripts/DiffusionPreprocessingBatch.sh is similar to struct preprocessing scripts
